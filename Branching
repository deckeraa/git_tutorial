After the repository is set up, users will want to create branches from the
master repository in order to develop without damaging the master repository.
This assumes that the user already has access to the repository on his/her
local machine.

1. Navigate to the directory of your repository.
2. Create a branch by typing in "git branch <name>" where you replace <name>
   with the name of the branch you desire.
3. Checkout that branch by typing "git checkout <name>" where <name> is the
   name of the branch.
   Note: These last 2 steps can be shortened by using the -b switch on checkout
   Example: "git checkout -b <name>" where <name> is the name of the branch
   you wish to create.
4. You can now commit to the new branch.  Any changes here will be separate
   from the master branch.
5. After making changes to the branch, you might want to get back to the master
   branch.  In order to do this, you can type "git checkout master".
   Note: You cannot have any uncommitted changes before you checkout.
         This can be avoided by using git stash (not covered here).
6. After making changes to your new branch, you will probably want to merge it
   with master.  This is covered in a separate section called "Merging"
