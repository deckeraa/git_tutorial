As a user, I would like to setup a Software_Quality respository thats going to
be public so I can save all of software Quality files in there.

1) The user will need to go to the Github.com website.
2) The user will need to sign into github with their username and password.
3) On the top right hand corner to the right of your username, there is a 
   button that looks like a book with a plus sign that the user will click.
4) Type in Software_Quality in the text box that has repository name label
   above it.
5) Make sure that the public radio button is clicked underneath the Description
   Text box.
6) Click on the check box that says "Initialize this repository with a README"
7) You dont need to add a gitgnore or a license.
8) Click on "Create Repository" button.
9) You have finished creating the Software_Quality repository.
